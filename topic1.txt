Aryabhata was India’s first satellite, named after a ancient Indian mathematician (5th century AD). It was launched by the Russians on 19 April 1975 from Kapustin Yar. The 96.3 minute orbit had an apogee of
 619 km and a perigee of 563 km, at an inclination of 50.7 degrees. Aryabhata was built by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy, aeronomics, and solar physics. The spacecraft was a 26-sided polygon 1.4 m in diameter. All faces (except the top and bottom) were covered with solar cells. A power failure halted experiments
 after 4 days in orbit. All signals from the spacecraft were lost after 5 days of operation. The satellite reentered the Earth’s atmosphere on 11 February 1992.
Aryabhata Satellite', you must have heard this word many times in your life. Have you ever thought about its history and other information? If not, then you don't need to worry now. We have created some sets of 10 lines on 'Aryabhata Satellite' and brought for you below. These points will help you in understanding what the word stands for. So let's begin.

The Aryabhata Satellite was the first success of India into space. It was built with 26 polygons and looked almost spherical. All its faces were made of the solar cell to provide it continue the ability to work with solar energy. The launch of Aryabhata was just a beginning, and India is creating history since then in Astronomy with its unprecedented successes.8) The satellite entered the earth’s atmosphere again on 11 February 1992.
